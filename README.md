Hi!

If you're reading this, might I instead suggest 'Sunset at a Lake', by Robert Bly, 
from his collection Silence in the Snowy Fields : Poems

----------------------------
The sun is sinking. Here on the pine-haunted bank,
the mosquitoes fly around drowsily, and moss stands out as
if it wanted to speak. Calm falls on the lake, which now
seems heavier and inhospitable. Far out, rafts of ducks drift
like closed eyes, and a thin line of silver caused by something invisible slowly moves toward shore in the viscous
darkness under the southern bank. Only a few birds, the
troubled ones, speak to the darkening roof of earth; small
weeds stand abandoned, the clay is sending her gifts back
to the center of the earth.
