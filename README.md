Hi!

If you're reading this, might I instead suggest 'Surprised by Evening', by Robert Bly, 
from his collection *Silence in the Snowy Fields : Poems*


**Surprised by Evening**  

1  There is unknown dust that is near us,  
2  Waves breaking on shores just over the hill,  
3  Trees full of birds that we have never seen,  
4  Nets drawn down with dark fish.  

5  The evening arrives; we look up and it is there,  
6  It has come through the nets of the stars,  
7  Through the tissues of the grass,  
8  Walking quietly over the asylums of the waters.  

9  The day shall never end, we think:  
10  We have hair that seems born for the daylight;  
11  But, at last, the quiet waters of the night will rise,  
12  And our skin shall see far off, as it does under water.
